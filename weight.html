The term <span style="color:#9DC149">weight</span> is used colloquially and in the biological and medical sciences to refer to a person's mass or <span style="color:#9DC149">weight</span>.<br>
 weight is measured in kilograms, a measure of mass, throughout the world,<br> the body <span style="color:#9DC149">weight</span> is the <span style="color:#9DC149">weight</span> of the person without any items on,
 but practically body weight is taken with clothes on but often without the shoes and heavy accessories like mobile phones and wallets.
 While the terms mass and <span style="color:#9DC149">weight</span> are often used interchangeably in the context of body <span style="color:#9DC149">weight</span>, 
 they actually refer to separate but related concepts in physics.<br> Mass is a measure of an object's inertia and is independent of the effects of gravity, 
 while <span style="color:#9DC149">weight</span> is a measure of the force due to gravity.<br> Thus, if a person were to travel from Earth to the Moon,
 where there is less gravity, their mass would remain unchanged but their <span style="color:#9DC149">weight</span> would decrease.
 <br>
You’ve probably wondered at one time or another how much you should <span style="color:#9DC149">weight</span>.<br>
<br>Your ideal weight depends on a number of different factors, including:<br>

<span style="color:#9DC149" ><h2>How do you determine if you are overweight or underweight?</h2></span><br>
The BMI is a convenient rule of thumb used to broadly categorize a person as underweight,
 normal weight, overweight, or obese based on tissue mass (muscle, fat, and bone) and height.<br>
 That categorization is the subject of some debate about where on the BMI scale the dividing lines 
between categories should be placed.<br>
Commonly accepted BMI ranges are underweight (under 18.5 kg/m2),
 normal weight (18.5 to 25), overweight (25 to 30), and obese (over 30).<br>

Obesity is bad news for both body and mind. Not only can it make someone feel tired and uncomfortable, 
carrying extra weight puts added stress on the body, especially the bones and joints of the legs.<br> Kids and teens 
who are overweight are more likely to develop diabetes and other health problems. And overweight adults have a 
higher chance of getting heart diseas.<br>

 environmental conditions.<br></h4></li><!--tow-->
<li><span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3>Hormonal imbalances </h3></span>
<h4>A hormone  is any member of a class of signaling molecules,
 produced by glands in multicellular organisms, 
that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behavior.</h4><br></li><!--three-->
<li><span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3> Limited physical exercise</h3></span>

to aid growth and improve strength, 
preventing aging, developing muscles and the cardiovascular system, 
honing athletic skills, weight loss .</h4></li><!--four-->
<li> <span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3> Overeating</h3></span>
<h4>Overeating is the excess food consumed in relation to the energy that an o
rganism expends (or expels via excretion), leading to weight gaining and 
often obesity.
It may be regarded as an eating disorder.
Overeating can be a symptom of binge eating
 disorder or bulimia nervosa.</h4></li><!--five-->

<br>
<span style="color:#9DC149" ><h2>Overweight Problems</h2></span>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#9DC149" ><b>Asthma:</span> Obesity increases the chance of having asthma.
 Breathing problems related to weight can make it harder to keep up with friends,
 play sports, or just walk from class to class</li><!--1-->
 <li><span style="color:#9DC149" ><b>High blood pressure:</span>
 When blood pressure is high the heart has to work harder.
 If the problem continues for a long time, high blood pressure can damage the heart and arteries. </li><!--2-->
 <li><span style="color:#9DC149" ><b>Joint and muscle pain: </span> 
 Wear and tear on the joints from carrying extra weight may lead to arthritis in adulthood.</li><!--3-->
 <li><span style="color:#9DC149" ><b>Insulin resistance and diabetes: </span>
 Insulin is a hormone that lowers 
 the level of glucose (a type of sugar) in the blood. When there is
 too must body fat, insulin is less effective at getting glucose,
 the body's main source of energy, into cells. The body then needs more insulin to maintain a
 normal blood sugar level. For some overweight teens, insulin resistance progresses to diabetes (high blood sugar).</li><!--4-->
 </ul>
 
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<span style="color:#9DC149" ><h2>Underweight</h2></span><br>
Being underweight can represent as many health concerns to an individual as being overweight can. 
If a person is underweight, their body may not be getting the nutrients it needs to build healthy bones, skin, and hair<br>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<span style="color:#9DC149" ><h2>Underweight causes</h2></span><br>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3> genetics:</h3></span> 
Genetics is a branch of biology concerned with the study of
 genes, genetic variation, and heredity in organisms.</li><!--1-->
<li><span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3> improper metabolism of nutrients, lack of food: </h3></span>
is the set of life-sustaining chemical reactions in organisms. The three main purposes of metabolism are:
<br> the conversion of food to energy to run cellular processes;<br> the conversion of food/fuel 
to building blocks for proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and some carbohydrates; and the elimination of nitrogenous wastes. </li><!--2-->
<li><span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3> drugs that affect appetite: </h3></span> 
Appetite is the desire to eat food, sometimes due to hunger. Appealing foods can 
stimulate appetite even when hunger is absent, although appetite can be greatly reduced by satiety.<br>
 Appetite exists in all higher life-forms, and serves to regulate adequate energy intake to maintain metabolic needs.<br>
 It is regulated by a close interplay between the digestive tract, adipose tissue and the brain.
 Appetite has a relationship with every individual's behavior. Decreased desire to eat is termed anorexia, while polyphagia (or "hyperphagia") 
is increased eating. Dysregulation of appetite contributes to anorexia nervosa,
 bulimia nervosa, cachexia, overeating, and binge eating disorder</li><!--3-->
<li><span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3> gastrointestinal or liver problems: </h3></span> 
The liver is an accessory digestive organ that produces bile, a fluid containing cholesterol and bile acids, 
and an alkaline compound which helps the breakdown of fat. Bile aids in digestion via the emulsification of lipids.<br>
 The gallbladder, a small pouch that sits just under the liver, stores bile produced by the 
 liver which is afterwards moved to the small intestine to complete digestion.<br>
 The liver's highly specialized tissue consisting of mostly hepatocytes regulates a wide variety
 of high-volume biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex molecules, 
many of which are necessary for normal vital functions.</li><!--4-->
<li><span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3> excessive exercise, </h3></span></li><!--5-->
</ul>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->
<span style="color:#9DC149" ><h2>Underweight Problems</h2></span><br>
<span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3>Weakened immune system:</h3></span>
 your immune system isn't 100% when you're underweight, so you're more likely to catch a cold, the flu or other infections.<br>
 <span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3>Lack of Energy:</h3></span>
 When your body fat is low, you don’t have extra stores of fat for your body to draw upon when it needs additional energy.<br> 
 That often translates to a low energy level and frequent feeling of fatigue, which low iron levels can exacerbate.<br>
 You might not have to run a marathon to feel fatigued. Instead, your lack of energy might kick in when you’re doing relatively sedentary tasks.<br>
  <span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3>Anemia:</h3></span>
  is a decrease in the total amount of red blood cells (RBCs) 
  or hemoglobin in the blood,or a lowered ability of the blood to carry oxygen.<br>
  When anemia comes on slowly, the symptoms are often vague and may include feeling tired,
  weakness, shortness of breath, and a poor ability to exercise<br>
   <span style="color:#9DC149" ><h3>Osteoporosis:</h3></span>
   is a disease in which bone weakening increases the risk of a broken bone.
