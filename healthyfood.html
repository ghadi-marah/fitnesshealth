Despite what you may have heard, eating breakfast isn't necessary for everyone.<br>
In fact, skipping breakfast may be better than eating unhealthy breakfast foods.<br>
However, a nutritious, well-balanced breakfast can give you energy and prevent you from eating too much during the rest of the day.<br>
<span style="color:#9DC149">Here are the some of  best foods you can eat in the morning.</span></td>

<hr><span style="color:#9DC149 ">Eggs </span><br>
<br>Studies have shown that eating eggs at breakfast increases feelings of fullness, reduces calorie intake at the next meal and helps maintain 
steady blood sugar and insulin levels .<br>
In one study, men who ate eggs for breakfast felt more satisfied and took in fewer calories during the rest of the day than those who consumed a
 bagel.<br>
Additionally, egg yolks contain<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/lutein-and-zeaxanthin"> lutein and zeaxanthin. </a> 
These antioxidants help prevent eye disorders like cataracts and macular degeneration .<br>
Eggs are also one of the best sources of choline, a very important nutrient for brain and liver health .<br>
Though high in cholesterol, eggs don't raise cholesterol levels in most people.<br>
In fact, eating whole eggs may reduce heart disease risk by modifying the shape of “bad” LDL cholesterol, increasing “good” HDL cholesterol and improving insulin sensitivity (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).
What's more, three large eggs provide about 20 grams of high-quality<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-protein-per-day"> protein </a>.<br>
Eggs are also very versatile.<br>
<span style="color:#9DC149" >For example, hard-boiled eggs make a great portable breakfast that can be prepared ahead of time.</span><br></td>

<hr><span style="color:#9DC149 ">Greek Yogurt</span>
<br>
It’s made by straining whey and other liquid from milk curds, which produces a creamier yogurt that is more concentrated in protein.<br>
Protein has been shown to reduce feelings of hunger and has a higher thermic effect than fat or carbs .<br>
The term thermic effect refers to the increase in metabolic rate that occurs after eating.<br>
Yogurt and other dairy products can also help with weight control because they increase levels 
of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-fixes-for-weight-hormones">hormones</a> that promote fullness, including PYY and GLP-1.<br>
What’s more, full-fat yogurt contains<a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/conjugated-linoleic-acid"> conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)</a>, which may increase fat 
loss and decrease breast cancer risk.<br>
Certain types of Greek yogurt are good sources of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/probiotics-101">probiotics </a>like Bifidobacteria, 
which help your gut stay healthy.<br>
To make sure your yogurt contains probiotics, look for the phrase contains live and active cultures on the label.<br>
Try topping Greek yogurt with berries or chopped fruit to increase your meal's vitamin, mineral and fiber content.<br></td>

<br>
It's high in caffeine, which has been shown to improve mood, alertness and mental performance.<br>
Even small amounts of caffeine can achieve these effects .<br>
An analysis of 41 studies found the most effective dose to be 38–400 mg per day to maximize the benefits of caffeine while reducing side effects.<br>
This is roughly 0.3 to 4 cups of coffee per day, depending on the coffee’s strength .<br>
Caffeine has also <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/coffee-increase-metabolism">been shown </a>to increase metabolic rate and fat burning. <br>
In one study, 100 mg of caffeine per day helped people burn an extra 79–150 calories over a 24-hour period .<br>
In addition, coffee is rich in antioxidants, which reduce inflammation, protect the cells lining your blood vessels and decrease diabetes and liver disease risk</td>

<hr><span style="color:#9DC149 ">Oatmeal</span>
<br>
It's made from ground <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-benefits-oats-oatmeal">oats</a>, which contain a unique fiber called oat beta-glucan. This fiber has many impressive health benefits,
 including reduced cholesterol (26Trusted Source, 27Trusted Source).<br>
What’s more, oat beta-glucan is a viscous fiber that promotes feelings of fullness.<br>
 One study found that it increased levels of the fullness hormone PYY and that higher doses had the greatest effect (28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source, 30Trusted Source).<br>
Oats are also rich in antioxidants, which protect their fatty acids from becoming rancid.
 These antioxidants may also benefit heart health and decrease blood pressure (31, 32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source).<br>
Though oats don't contain gluten, they're often processed in the same facilities as gluten-containing grains. 
Researchers have found that most oats are indeed contaminated with other grains, especially barley (34Trusted Source).<br>
Therefore, people with <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/celiac-disease-symptoms">celiac disease</a> 
or <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gluten-sensitivity-is-real">gluten sensitivity </a>
should choose oats that have been certified as gluten-free.<br>
Bear in mind that one cup (235 grams) of cooked oatmeal contains only about 6 grams of protein, which won't provide the benefits of a higher-protein breakfast <br>
To boost the protein content of an oatmeal breakfast, prepare it with milk instead of water or serve it with a side of eggs or a piece of cheese.</td>

<br>
Berries are delicious and packed with antioxidants.<br>
Popular types include blueberries, raspberries, strawberries and blackberries.<br>
They're lower in sugar than most fruits, yet higher in fiber.<br>
In fact, raspberries and blackberries each provide an impressive 8 grams of fiber per cup or 120 and 145 grams, respectively (44, 45).<br>
What's more, one cup of berries contains only 50–85 calories depending on the type.<br>
Berries also pack antioxidants called anthocyanins, which protect your heart and may help you age better (46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source).<br>
Berries have been shown to reduce markers of inflammation, prevent blood cholesterol from oxidizing and keep the cells lining your blood vessels healthy (48Trusted Source, 49Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source, 51Trusted Source).<br>
A good way to add berries to your breakfast is to eat them with Greek yogurt or cottage cheese.</td>

Lunch is commonly the second meal of the day, after breakfast.<br>

<td><hr><span style="color:#9DC149 ">Complex Carbohydrates</span><br>
<br>Skipping complex carbs at lunch is sure to land you in the hunger zone 
later in the day.<br> Not only does your body digest them slowly, keeping you full longer,
 but they also happen to be very nutritious.<br> "Whole grains are rich in fiber, which is key for a 
 healthy digestive tract and preventing several types of cancer," says Mark Spielmann, RD, nutrition manager 
 of La Rabida Children's Hospital in Chicago.<br> When choosing bread, make sure it has at least two or three grams of fiber per slice
 and is made with 100 percent whole wheat. But you don't have to limit your carbs to bread.<br> "Sweet potatoes are a very complex carbohydrate
 , especially when you eat the skin, which will be digested slowly, keeping you
 full for several hours," says Megan Moore, RD, from Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas.
 They're also rich in vitamin A and vitamin C, and help lower blood pressure, too.</td>

<td><hr><span style="color:#9DC149 ">Protein</span><br>
<br>Proteins are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. <br>
Because your body digests proteins slower than other food groups,
 incorporating them into your midday meal will provide you with some 
 serious lasting power. <br>
 Moore suggests salmon, an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids, which are good for your heart.<br>
 She also recommends chicken, which is easy to incorporate into almost any lunch. 
 <br>But fish and poultry aren't the only good sources of protein. 
 Next time you're at the salad bar, throw in black beans, kidney beans,
 lima beans, pinto beans or navy beans for extra protein and extra fiber.</td>

 Fresh Fruit makes for a perfect lunchtime dessert that won't cause your energy to crash in the late afternoon, unlike other sugary options.<br>
 But it's also an excellent add-in to salads and sandwiches. <br>
 "The high amount of monounsaturated fat [about 6g per 1/4 cup] in an avocado will fill you up significantly," says Moore.<br>
 She suggests slicing it over a salad or making a spread for your sandwich. <br>
 "Apples contain 5 grams of fiber  and are about 80 percent water, so they fill your belly—making them a great 'dessert' option." <br>
 Spielmann also recommends raisins, which are sweet, portable and loaded with fiber.</td>

Just because you don't like milk doesn't mean you have to skip your dairy intake. <br>

 When choosing dairy, pick reduced-fat versions to limit  saturated fats but maximize lasting power. <br>
 "Ending your meal with a container of lowfat yogurt provides protein and calcium—and satisfies your dessert craving," Speilmann notes.</td>

Fatty fish like salmon is incredibly healthy and very satisfying, keeping you full for many hours with relatively few calories.<br>
Salmon is loaded with high-quality protein, healthy fats and various important nutrients.<br>
Fish — and seafood in general — may also supply a significant amount of iodine.<br>
This nutrient is necessary for proper thyroid function, which is important to keep your metabolism running optimally (7Trusted Source).<br>
Studies show that a significant number of people don’t fill their iodine needs (8Trusted Source).<br>
Salmon is also loaded with omega-3 fatty acids, which have been shown to help reduce inflammation, 
which is known to play a major role in obesity and metabolic disease (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source).<br>
Mackerel, trout, sardines, herring and other types of fatty fish are also excellent.</td>

While most fruits are high in carbs, avocados are loaded with healthy fats.<br>
They’re particularly high in monounsaturated oleic acid, the same type of fat found in olive oil.<br>
Despite being mostly fat, avocados also contain a lot of water and fiber, making them less energy-dense than you may think.<br>
What’s more, they’re a perfect addition to vegetable salads, as studies show that their fat content can increase carotenoid
 antioxidant absorption from the vegetables 2.6- to 15-fold .<br>

White potatoes seem to have fallen out of favor for some reason.<br>
However, they have several properties that make them a perfect food — both for weight loss and optimal health.<br>
They contain an incredibly diverse range of nutrients — a little bit of almost everything you need.<br>
There have even been accounts of people living on nothing but potatoes alone for extended periods of time.<br>
They’re particularly high in potassium, a nutrient that most people don't get enough of and that plays an important role in blood pressure control.<br>
On a scale called the Satiety Index, which measures how filling different foods are, white, boiled potatoes scored the highest of all the foods tested.<br>
What this means is that by eating white, boiled potatoes, you will naturally feel full and eat less of other foods.<br>
If you allow potatoes to cool for a while after boiling, they will form high amounts of resistant starch, 
a fiber-like substance that has been shown to have various health benefits, including weight loss<br>
Sweet potatoes, turnips and other root vegetables are also excellent.</td>

What’s more, population studies have shown that people who eat nuts tend to be healthier and leaner than those who don't .<br>
