10 health tips your doctor wishes you would follow

<ol type="1">
<li><span style="color:#9DC149">Stay hydrated</span></li><br>
When we're born, almost 97% of our body is made up of water. 
As adults, this figure falls slightly but still sits somewhere around 75%.<br>
 The vast majority of our brain cells are simply water, and even our teeth have 10% water content.<br>
 Every single cellular function in our body is in some way linked to our fluid levels:<br>
 blood and cancer-fighting immune systems require water to flush out waste products away from cells 
 and to transport nutrients and vital amino acids into them. Healthy cells work by
 absorbing nutrients from the water that bathes them, and even 2% body dehydration is
 said to cause energy levels to drop by one fifth! Don't wait until you're thirsty – drink water 
 (ideally, although tea and coffee is fine) all day to help keep your body at an optimum hydration level.<br>
<!--...........................................................-->
<br>
<li> <span style="color:#9DC149">Make time for good sleep</span></li><br>
Although there's no simple answer as to 
what's the 'normal' amount of sleep, most adults should aim for between 7 and 9 hours a night.<br>
<!--...........................................................-->
<br>
<li><span style="color:#9DC149">Eat well</span></li><br>
A balanced diet doesn't need to
 be difficult or complicated – the general key is to eat the right number of calories for how active you are.<br>
 If you eat or drink too much, you'll put on weight. If you eat and drink too little, you'll lose weight. <br>
 The average man needs around 2,500 calories a day and the average woman needs 2,000. <br>
 Eat a wide range of foods to ensure you're getting balanced nutrition.<br>
<!--...........................................................-->
<br>
<li><span style="color:#9DC149">If you need to…lose weight</span></li><br>
The UK is fast becoming the most obese country in Europe,
 thanks to poor diets and lack of exercise.<br>
 Eating a healthy, balanced diet plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy weight, 
 which is an important part of overall good health.<br>
 Being overweight or obese can lead to health conditions such as type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, heart disease, and stroke.<br>
<!--...........................................................-->
<br>
<li><span style="color:#9DC149">Move more</span></li><br>
Physical activity can help you to maintain weight loss or be a healthy weight but being active
 doesn't have to mean spending hours at the gym:<br> try getting off the bus one stop early on the 
 way home from work and walking, or taking the stairs at work rather than the elevator.<br>
 Just find something active you enjoy doing – whether it's cycling, running, dancing or gardening – and do more of it.<br>
<!--...........................................................-->
<br>
<li><span style="color:#9DC149">Stop smoking</span></li><br>
Giving up smoking is probably the greatest single step you can take to improve your health.<br>
 About half of all smokers die from smoking-related diseases. <br>
 If you are a long-term smoker, on average, your life expectancy is about 10 years less than a non-smoker and 
 only about half of long-term smokers live past 70.<br>
 The younger you are when you start smoking, the more likely you are to smoke for longer and to die early from smoking.<br>
 Smokers who quit before the age of 45 have a life expectancy close to that of people who have never smoked. <br>
 For people above this age, the gap widens,
 but smokers who quit over the age of 45 still enjoy considerable health benefits over people who continue to smoke.<br>
<!--...........................................................-->
<br>
<li><span style="color:#9DC149">Take your medication correctly</span></li><br>
Medication non-compliance – the failure to take drugs on time in the dosages prescribed – 
is a huge problem both in the UK and other countries. Although hard facts are a little tricky to come by for obvious reasons,<br>
 it has been estimated that at least 50% of patients fail to comply with chronic drug therapy, 
 leading to poor control of their medical conditions and all the associated risks that go with that. <br>
 You always need to take medications as instructed by your doctor – even if your symptoms subside.<br>
 If you have any concerns about why you're taking a certain medication, don't stop taking it but talk your concerns over with your doctor.<br>
<!--...........................................................-->
<br>
<li> <span style="color:#9DC149">Wash your hands</span></li><br>
Washing your hands is one of the most effective contribution you can make to public health – second only to vaccination in 
terms of effectiveness at reducing infection.<br>
 Use hot water and soap (or an alcohol hand cleaning gel if this is impractical) 
 to wash your hands after preparing food, going to the toilet, blowing your nose,
 coughing or sneezing into your hands, after handling household waste, before preparing food or eating,
 when caring for a sick person, or when inserting or removing contact lenses.<br>
<!--...........................................................-->
<br>
<li><span style="color:#9DC149">Cover up in the sun</span></li><br>
People used to associate a deep tan with good health, 
but it's actually a sign of serious skin damage. The rising
 numbers of skin cancer cases in the UK – especially in the young –
 show the price that can be paid. Using tanning beds further increases this risk.<br>
 People most at risk include those with fair skin (especially people with blonde or 
 red hair with freckles) and those who have been sunburnt in the past (especially with blisters, and even if
 this happened many years previously). If you have more than ten moles, your risk increases as does using sun beds – 
 or if there is a history of skin cancer in your family.<br>
<!--...........................................................-->
<br>
<li><span style="color:#9DC149" border>Relax</span></li><br>
We all get stressed from time to time, but chronic stress is not only bad for your health in general,
 it can prevent you from relaxing even when you have the chance to.<br>
 Using relaxation techniques can help relieve the symptoms of stress as well as helping to defuse stressful situations, 
 allowing you to take charge of your emotions and clear your head.<br>
 All relaxation techniques combine breathing techniques along with muscle relaxation and it can take time to learn these
 skills – don't worry if it seems strange at the start.<br> Keep practising and it will come. Some people find that going 
 to yoga or tai chi classes are a good way of improving both breathing and relaxation.<br>
